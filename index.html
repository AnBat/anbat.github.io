<h2 id="title_font">Personal Profile</h2>
<p>I'm a software developer with experience of working on high-performance cross-platform network applications. I also worked with the embedded system based on ARM architecture. I have more than three years of experience in software development using C++ and Qt framework. I always do self-improvement and a lot of reading literature, paying particular attention to the technical literature . Example of the latest books I would like to mention the book&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Martin Fowler - Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</span> from which I have learned many useful things.</p>
